## Participating Agencies

The State Department of Education (SDE), the Office of Early Childhood (OEC), the Department of Labor (DOL), the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU), the University of Connecticut (UCONN), the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges (CCIC), the Department of Social Services (DSS), the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the Office of Higher Education (OHE) and the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness (CCEH) are actively collaborating to support the P20 WIN System. The system is designed with flexibility to expand and include additional state agencies or organizations such as the Department of Public Health and the Department of Housing. The process for an agency or state organization to join P20 WIN is defined in the “How to Become a Participating Agency” within this manual.

Each participating agency is responsible for the data that reside in their respective systems.  The Data Governance Policy does not affect data that is not shared through P20 WIN.  Rather, this policy covers only the data that is shared between organizations both at the unit and aggregate level through P20 WIN.  While data will be transported, matched and eventually stored electronically, this manual covers the use of shared data in reports and documents whether electronic or in print.
